Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility \nfor the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with \nthe Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are \nrelevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and \nwe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe \nthat the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in \nthe sub-paragraphs (a) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on \nthe consolidated financial statements. \nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters we have \ndetermined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nSr. \nNo.\nKey Audit Matter\nAuditor’s Response\n1.\nRevenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the \npercentage of completion method\nRevenue \nfrom \nfixed \nprice \ncontracts \nincluding \nsoftware \ndevelopment and system integration contracts is recognized using \na percentage of completion method. Use of the percentage-of-\ncompletion method requires the Group to determine the actual \ncosts expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total \ncosts to be incurred. Costs expended have been used to measure \nprogress towards completion as there is a direct relationship \nbetween input and productivity.\nWe identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts where \nthe percentage of completion is used as a Key Audit Matter since –\n•\t\nHigh inherent risk around accuracy of revenue, given the \ncustomized and complex nature of these contracts.\n•\t\nHigh inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of \nprogress of the contract, costs incurred to-date and estimates \nof costs required to complete the remaining contract \nperformance obligations over the term of the contract.\nPrincipal audit procedures performed:\nOur audit procedures included the following, among others:\n•\t\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to\n(1)\t\nrecording of costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs \nrequired to complete the remaining contract performance \nobligations and\n(2)\t access and application controls pertaining to time recording, \nallocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorized \nchanges to recording of efforts incurred.\n•\t\nWe selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers \nmeasured using the percentage-of-completion method and \nperformed the following: \n\t\n–\t\nRead the contract and based on the terms and conditions \nevaluated whether recognizing revenue over time using \npercentage of completion method was appropriate, and \nthe contract was included in management’s calculation of \nrevenue over time.\nSr. \nNo.\nKey Audit Matter\nAuditor’s Response\n•\t\nAt year-end, significant amount of work in progress (Unbilled \nrevenue), related to these contracts is recognised on the \nbalance sheet.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the \naudit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the \nreasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue and \nunbilled revenue recognized on these fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\t\n–\t\nCompared costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts \nor costs incurred to date to identify significant variations \nand evaluate whether those variations have been considered \nappropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to \ncomplete the contract.\n\t\n–\t\nTested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery \nof milestones and customer acceptances and sign off from \ncustomers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, \nwhich require changes in estimated costs or efforts to \ncomplete the remaining performance obligations.\nInformation Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\n•\t The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included \nin the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and \nSustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial \nstatements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\n•\t Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of \nassurance conclusion thereon.\n•\t In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, compare \nwith the financial statements of the subsidiaries audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates to these entities and, in \ndoing so, place reliance on the work of the other auditors and consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent \nwith the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to \nbe materially misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, is traced from their financial statements audited \nby the other auditors.\n•\t If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are \nrequired to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements\nThe Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of \nthese consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial \nperformance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group \nin accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. \nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting \nrecords in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting \nfrauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are \nreasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating \neffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of \nthe financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which \nhave been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in \nthe Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, \nmatters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either \nintend to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting \nprocess of the Group.\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nOur vision for a limitless future. Faster. Together.\nLTIMindtree Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2023-24\n368\n369\nConsolidated\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable \nassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect \na material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nconsolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \naudit. We also:\n•\t Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, \ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate \nto provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control.\n•\t Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the \nParent has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating \neffectiveness of such controls.\n•\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \nmade by the management.\n•\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit \nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the \nability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \nattention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are \ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s \nreport. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n•\t Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, \nand whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves \nfair presentation.\n•\t Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an \nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit \nof the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent \nauditors.
